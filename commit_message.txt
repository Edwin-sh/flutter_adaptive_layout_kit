feat: Refactor API to centralize responsive logic

This commit refactors the library's API to centralize the responsive logic within the `ResponsiveGridService`.

Key changes:

*   **Breaking Change**: Removed `ResponsiveContextExtension`. The screen type is no longer determined through `BuildContext` extensions.
*   Introduced `ResponsiveScreenInitializer` as the new entry point for initializing the responsive system. This widget should wrap the `MaterialApp`.
*   `ResponsiveGridService` is now a singleton instance, accessible globally via `responsiveGridService`. It uses the `sizer` package directly to determine the screen type.
*   `ResponsiveLayoutBuilder` and `ResponsiveText` have been updated to consume the screen type from the `responsiveGridService`.
*   Updated the documentation and examples to reflect the new API.
*   Incremented the package version to `0.0.2`.

This refactoring simplifies the API, improves maintainability, and makes the responsive logic more explicit and easier to use.
